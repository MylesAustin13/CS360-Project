## Current Objectives

1) Convert C to Assembly 
2) Create interactive UI to show code running step by step
3) Visually represent Memory, Registers, and rsp, rbp, etc.

## TEST PROGRAM SETUP 
Ask user to continuously input random integers until the number of entered reaches 10. Each time the user enters a new integer, the current maximum and minimum integers in the saved list are output to the screen. You can simply assume that all integers are non-negtive. You can also assume that all integers are small values and can be represented by 1 byte .

•  Write a program to solve the above problem in high level source code such as C and C++.
•  You have to utilzie the function calls instead of using a single verbose function to do all the works.
•  Translate your program into assembly language. Compare your code with https://godbolt.org/.
