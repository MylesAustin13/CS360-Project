## Current Objectives

1) Write test program - DONE
2) Write program to convert C to assembly - WiP
          - Parsing code to split c code into functions - DONE
          - Parsing code to convert c functions into assembly - WiP
3) Create interactive UI to show code running step by step
4) Visually represent Memory, Registers, and rsp, rbp, etc.

## Details
- To get user input and output (cin and cout), assume the cin function saves input to arbitrary memory location e.g. location of input goes to location 1000 and outputs to 2000

## TEST PROGRAM SETUP
Ask user to continuously input random integers until the number of entered reaches 10. Each time the user enters a new integer, the current maximum and minimum integers in the saved list are output to the screen. You can simply assume that all integers are non-negative. You can also assume that all integers are small values and can be represented by 1 byte .

•  Write a program to solve the above problem in high level source code such as C and C++.

•  You have to utilize the function calls instead of using a single verbose function to do all the works.

•  Translate your program into assembly language. Compare your code with https://godbolt.org/.
